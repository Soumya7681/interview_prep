# Chapter 49 — Self-Introduction

## 📖 Why It Matters

The first 90 seconds set the tone for the rest of the interview. A confident, well-structured intro:
- Gets the panel nodding.
- Triggers the questions you want them to ask.
- Buys you credibility before the technical grilling.

## 🧱 The 4-Beat Structure (90 seconds)

1. **Who you are now** — role, company, total experience.
2. **What you do day-to-day** — stack and responsibilities.
3. **One headline achievement** — quantified impact.
4. **Why you're here** — career direction.

## 💬 Your Template (Tailored for TCS)

> "Hi, I'm Soumyaranjan Rout. I'm currently working as a Full-Stack Developer at Hyscaler with around three years of experience.
>
> My primary stack is React.js on the frontend and Node.js with NestJS on the backend, along with MongoDB and AWS services — mostly S3 for file handling.
>
> Before Hyscaler, I was at Technoboot Pvt Ltd, where I worked on the MERN stack and built production REST APIs.
>
> Some of my recent work includes:
> - A scalable file-upload service on NestJS + AWS S3 with secure pre-signed URLs and MIME validation.
> - A role-based access system using JWT and refresh tokens with rotation.
> - Performance optimizations on a high-traffic dashboard — reducing initial load time by around 50% using code splitting, memoization, and list virtualization.
>
> I'm now looking for a larger, more diverse engineering environment to keep growing as a full-stack engineer — which is why I'm excited about this opportunity at TCS."

## 🎙️ Delivery Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Speak at ~140 wpm | Slower feels confident; faster feels nervous |
| Pause between beats | Lets the interviewer absorb each chunk |
| Make eye contact | (Camera, if remote) |
| Keep hands visible, relaxed | Tells your body you're calm |
| End with an "anchor" line | "…which is why I'm excited about this role" gives a clean handoff |

## ⏱️ Time-Box Practice

- **Day 1:** Read the intro out loud 5 times.
- **Day 2:** Record yourself. Listen back — note filler words.
- **Day 3:** Have a friend interrupt mid-way; practice resuming smoothly.
- **Day of:** One run-through before the call.

## 🔁 Variants for Different Lengths

### 30-Second Quick Version
> "I'm Soumyaranjan, a Full-Stack Developer at Hyscaler with ~3 years on the MERN + NestJS stack. I've shipped JWT auth flows, file upload services on S3, and performance work that cut a dashboard's load time in half. I'm looking for a larger, more diverse environment — which is why I'm here."

### 2-Minute Detailed Version (Add Stories)
After the 4 beats, add:
- "On the upload service specifically, the problem was uploads were going through our API and bottlenecking. I introduced pre-signed URLs so the browser uploads directly to S3, cutting our API CPU by about half on those routes."
- "On the dashboard optimization, the original page rendered 5,000 rows at once. I introduced react-window for virtualization and lazy-loaded the analytics chart with React.lazy. First contentful paint went from ~2.4s to ~900ms."

## 🪞 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Better |
|---------|--------|
| "I've worked on many projects" | Name ONE specific project with impact |
| "I know React, Node, MongoDB, Redux, Express, NestJS, AWS, Docker…" | Mention stack, then anchor on one |
| Listing tasks without outcomes | "Reduced load time by 50%" beats "worked on performance" |
| Speaking too long (3+ minutes) | 90 seconds, max |
| Reading from notes | Practice until it sounds natural |
| Negative talk about current company | Frame as "looking for more / different / bigger" |

## 💡 Pro Move — End with a Hook

Drop one specific term that invites the interviewer's next question:
- *"…which is why I'm excited about a large product environment like TCS where I can work across more domains."*
- *"…I'd love to walk you through how we built the upload pipeline."*

This puts you in control of the next 5 minutes.
